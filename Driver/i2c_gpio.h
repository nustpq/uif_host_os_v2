/// !Purpose
///
/// Interface for configuration the Two Wire Interface (TWI) peripheral.
///
/// !Usage
///
/// -# Configures a TWI peripheral to operate in master mode, at the given
/// frequency (in Hz) using TWI_ConfigureMaster().
/// -# or if hardware possible, configures a TWI peripheral to operate in 
/// slave mode, at the given frequency (in Hz) using TWI_ConfigureSlave().
/// -# Sends a STOP condition on the TWI using TWI_Stop().
/// -# Starts a read operation on the TWI bus with the specified slave using
/// TWI_StartRead(). Data must then be read using TWI_ReadByte() whenever 
/// a byte is available (poll using TWI_ByteReceived()).
/// -# Starts a write operation on the TWI to access the selected slave using
/// TWI_StartWrite(). A byte of data must be provided to start the write;
/// other bytes are written next. 
/// -# Sends a byte of data to one of the TWI slaves on the bus using TWI_WriteByte().
/// This function must be called once before TWI_StartWrite() with the first byte of data
/// to send, then it shall be called repeatedly after that to send the remaining bytes.
/// -# Check if a byte has been received and can be read on the given TWI
/// peripheral using TWI_ByteReceived(). 
/// Check if a byte has been sent using TWI_ByteSent().
/// -# Check if the current transmission is complete (the STOP has been sent)
/// using TWI_TransferComplete().
/// -# Enables & disable the selected interrupts sources on a TWI peripheral
/// using TWI_EnableIt() and TWI_DisableIt().
/// -# Get current status register of the given TWI peripheral using
/// TWI_GetStatus(). Get current status register of the given TWI peripheral, but
/// masking interrupt sources which are not currently enabled using 
/// TWI_GetMaskedStatus().
